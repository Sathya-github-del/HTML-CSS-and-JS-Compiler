  Code Compiler and Live Output Viewer
  This project is a simple code compiler and live output viewer application built with React on the front-end and Node.js (Express) on the back-end. It allows users to write, compile, and see the output of their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real time. The application also provides console logging for JavaScript code, so users can see their console.log outputs directly in the interface.
  
  Key Features:
  Live Code Editor: Write and edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
  Instant Compilation: Automatically compiles and shows the result of the code written in the editor with real-time updates.
  Live Console Output: View console.log outputs directly in the output panel for JavaScript code.
  Code Syntax Highlighting: The code editor features syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for better readability.
  Responsive Design: The application is responsive, making it usable on a variety of screen sizes, from desktop to mobile.
  Error Handling: Displays syntax and compilation errors for better developer experience.
